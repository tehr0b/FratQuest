Your friend Chad, from High School invited you to a party here tonight. You've been putting off his invitations for almost all four years that you both have been in college, including all of freshman year when you two were roommates. But now, you're finally here, and even Your Girlfriend, Stacy is supposed to be here tonight. Might as well give it the old college try, eh?&#x000A;&#x000A;You are outside of the fraternity house. On the side of the building are large, red metal letters, spelling out BRO.&#x000A;&#x000A;Two large, swinging doors block the path into the house.&#x000A;&#x000A;The biggest frat guy you've ever seen blocks your way into the party. The bouncer stands there, looking intimidating. You should try telling him about Chad in order to get into the party.&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;</result>
