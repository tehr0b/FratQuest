But now, you're finally here, and even Your Girlfriend, Stacy is supposed to be here tonight. Might as well give it the old college try, eh?&#x000A;&#x000A;You are outside of the fraternity house. On the side of the building are large, red metal letters, spelling out BRO.&#x000A;&#x000A;Two large, swinging doors block the path into the house.&#x000A;&#x000A;The biggest frat guy you've ever seen blocks your way into the party. The bouncer is turning away a few freshmen guys from the party. You should try telling him about Chad in order to get into the party.&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;</result>
